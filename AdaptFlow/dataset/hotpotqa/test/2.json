          " According to Bem, gender polarization begins when natural sex differences are exaggerated in culture; for example, women have less hair than men, and men have more muscles than women, but these physical differences are exaggerated culturally when women remove hair from their faces and legs and armpits, and when men engage in body building exercises to emphasize their muscle mass.",
          " She explained that gender polarization goes further, when cultures construct \"differences from scratch to make the sexes even more different from one another than they would otherwise be\", perhaps by dictating specific hair styles for men and women, which are noticeably distinct, or separate clothing styles for men and women.",
          " When genders become polarized, according to the theory, there is no overlap, no shared behaviors or attitudes between men and women; rather, they are distinctly opposite.",
