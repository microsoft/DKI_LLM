Ahlberg, who reclassified it as a new genus and species of early tetrapod.",
          " The genus name \"Occidens\" refers to its presence west of better-known early tetrapod assemblages in Great Britain, and the species name honors Portlock.",

          " The occurrence of \"Occidens\" in the Tournaisian makes it a critically important taxon because it lies within Romer's gap, a time interval spanning most of the Early Carboniferous in which almost no tetrapod fossils are known.",

          " However, the relationship of \"Occidens\" to other early tetrapods both before and after the gap remain uncertain, which means that its context in tetrapod evolution remains unknown.",
          " Clack and Ahlberg noted several distinctive features of \"Occidens\", including a straight row of teeth along the coronoid bones on the inner surface of the lower jaw, an open groove for a lateral line sense organ on the jaw's outer surface, and a stepped shape to the connection between the dentary and angular bones.",
          " The jaw bone is deep, resembling those of \"Crassigyrinus\" and whatcheeriids (which both occur in Romer's gap) in overall appearance.",
          " In most phylogenetic trees produced by Clack and Ahlberg's 2004 analysis, \"Occidens\" fell near whatcheeriids and the Devonian taxon \"Tulerpeton\", being more derived than all other Devonian taxa and more basal than \"Crassigyrinus\" and the post-Romer's Gap taxa \"Greererpeton\" and \"Megalocephalus\".",
