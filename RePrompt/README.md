In this paper, we propose RePrompt, a novel reprompting framework that introduces explicit reasoning into the prompt enhancement process via reinforcement learning. Instead of relying on handcrafted rules or stylistic rewrites, our method trains a language model to generate structured, self-reflective prompts by optimizing for image-level outcomes. The tailored reward models assesse the generated images in terms of human preference, semantic alignment, and visual composition, providing indirect supervision to refine prompt generation. Our approach enables end-to-end training without human-annotated data. Experiments on GenEval and T2I-Compbench show that RePrompt significantly boosts spatial layout fidelity and compositional generalization across diverse T2I backbones, establishing new state-of-the-art results.

## Quick Start üöÄ

### Step 1: Build Environment
```bash
conda create -n reprompt
conda activate reprompt
sh prepare.sh
```

Setup geneval with [geneval](https://github.com/djghosh13/geneval).

Setup t2i-compbench with [t2i-compbench](https://github.com/Karine-Huang/T2I-CompBench). And put it in directory ```evaluation```.

### Step 2: Init RePrompt with SFT


We use the following script to init our model with sft:

```shell
FORCE_TORCHRUN=1 llamafactory-cli train configs/qwen25-3b-full-sft.yaml 
```

### Step 3: Train RePrompt with RL


We use the following script to train our model with rl:

```shell
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 accelerate launch --config_file=configs/rl_ds2.yaml train_reprompt.py \
  --data data/generation_prompts_1k_filterd.txt \
  --gpt_path output/Qwen2.5-3B-sft \
  --sdmodel_name black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev \
  --outdir /output/reprompt_with_flux
```

### Step 4: Eval RePrompt


We use the following script to run our model on GenEval Benchmark:

```shell
torchrun --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=8 --node_rank=0 evaluation/reprompt_infer_geneval.py
sh evaluation/geneval/eval.sh
```

We use the following script to run our model on T2I-CompBench:

```shell
torchrun --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=8 --node_rank=0 evaluation/reprompt_infer_t2icomp.py
```

And get the metrics with [T2I-CompBench](https://github.com/Karine-Huang/T2I-CompBench) instruction.
